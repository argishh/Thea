#### Thea was created as a part of my standard 12th's final python project. Not to worry, it has been refined a bit since then, i.e. it works ðŸ˜‰. 
#### P.S. Working on this project inspired me to explore the field of AI and that was one of the main reasons why I choose AI&ML as my field of study in University.
