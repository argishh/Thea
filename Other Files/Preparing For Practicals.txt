P.S. This was my 12th standard final Project so I had to show this program to the external invigilator on the day of final practicals. I didn't expect that but it was fun!


-> Understanding Modules Imported:

8 modules/libraries imported:
pyttsx3, speech_recognition, datetime, wikipedia, webbrowser, OS, smtplib, random.

import is a python command which connects/embedds other python modules to current program.

pyttsx3 is a text to speech conversion library in python.

speech_recognition is a Library for performing speech recognition.In speechrecognition as sr (sr is alias).

datetime is a module which allows the use of current date and time of the system in python.

Wikipedia is a Python library that makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia.
	
webbrowser is a module which connects my assistant with the webbrowser. By default the webbrowser is internet explorer. 
    To open Chrome,
	chrome_path = 'C:\\Path\\Chrome.exe'
	webbrowser.get(chrome_path).open('www.google.com')

OS is a module which helps performing the tasks within the system, like opening a file, etc. 

smtplib stands for simple mail transfer protocol. this module is used to send mail to any internet machine.

random module generates pseudo-random numbers(both float and integers). 
	[This module cannot be used for security puproses, secrets module is used instead.]




Understanding the main code:

getProperty function gets the current property of variable.
setProperty function changes or adds propert of variiable.

SAPI5 (speech appliocation programming interface) is an API developed by Microsoft to easily allow the use of speech recognition and speech synthesis within windows applications. SAPI5 is the latest version.

__init__ refrences the module itself.

I embedded wikipedia to my program using import wikipedia so that each time user needs any information, the program can provide it by searching about it on wikipedia.

pyttsx3.init() function gives a reference to a pyttsx3.Engine.

runAndWait() is a function which blocks further commands until prior commands are executed.

datetime.datetime.now().hour gives the current hour.
datetime.datetime,now().strftime('%H:%M:%S') guves the current time in the format of Hour:Minute:seconds.
	[if we use from datetime import datetime, the the code will be datetime.now().hour]

except is used to prevent the program from running into any abnormal conditions.

smtplib.SMTP('smtp.google.com', 587) is used to select server. In our case, we selected server as google with port = 587

server.ehlo() is used to identify ourselves with an extended simple mail transfer protocol(ESMTP).

SMTP.starttls() will establish a connection in TLS(Transport Layer Security) mode, here, all data SMTP will be encrypted. ehlo is needed to use TLS. 

SMTP.sendmail(from_addr, to_addrs, msg) is command to send mail.

When python runs a program, it assigns a __name__ to it. If the program is being runned as the main program, then its name will be __main__. and if the program is already running and we open another instance of it, than, it wont run as it wont have name __main__.

.lower() will return the string data in lowercase.

.replace(a,b) is an amazing inbuild function which will replace all occurances of the string 'a' with string 'b' in the query.
